# Factorio Inserter Test

These scripts generate blueprints containing various configurations of [Bob's
adjustable inserters](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Bobingabout/bobinserters)
for the game [Factorio](http://factorio.com).

Fully researched, the inserter pickup and dropoff locations can independently
be in any location on a 7x7 grid. In addition, the dropoff location can have an
offset from a 3x3 grid, which is like a 20% nudge in the given direction.
Altogether, that's 7x7x7x7x9 for a grand total of 21,609.

Difficult to test that many configurations by hand. Enter automation!
